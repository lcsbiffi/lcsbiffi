Hi, my name is Lucas, but a lot of people also call me by my surname Biffi. Either way goes. :)

I'm a Journalist specialized in PR for tech companies, having worked for Salesforce, Samsung, Google, Huawei, CenturyLink, Sophos and much more. 
I also have a MBA in Marketing.

Lately, I've been especially interested in learning more about Data Science and Machine Learning to see how much impact these technologies can have in solving all kinds of problems.

Here you'll find everything I'm working on. Hope you do not leave (very) disappointed. 

Also, pointers are ALWAYS welcomed and appreciated!
